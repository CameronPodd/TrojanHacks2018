# TrojanHacks2018
TrojanHacks Strikes Back 2018 project: USC Bingo. Made in a 24-hour period and based entirely in HTML/CSS and JavaScript, this program creates bingo boards for the user to play on based on certain USC-focused categories. Clicking the picture of the students, for example, will generate a bingo board with USC student-focused information in the squares. Notice that reloading the bingo board page randomizes the information in board squares so no two playthroughs are completely identical.

Team members: Elizabeth Zhou, Sean Vovan, Cameron Podd, and Laurence Fong. At the time this project was made, none of us had any experience using JavaScript and only Laurence had encountered HTML/CSS before.

Features to Implement: A multiplayer function, where two players could compete to fill his/her own board faster than their opponent; the ability for the user to create their own bingo boards; geofencing, such that the program automatically selects a board for you based upon your current location (Being near a football field would automatically select the football-based bingo board, for example).
